# A Javascript event calender written on ES6

A javascript event calendar that implements over algorithms to detect both collisions and overlapping at the same time. Enable users to accomodate 'n' number of events without overlapping on the  same calender. Events having overlapping timings are arranged horizontally and following events are arranged based on space available on its left-side.
